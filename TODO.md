# engine TODO

- Need to think about how much of it is a graphics engine vs a game engine.
  - Most callback stuff is located in SCDG game code right now, and not actually in the engine.
  - Furthermore, do we want it to be a visual novel game engine strictly? That would involve a lot of code-moving to the engine from SCDG
