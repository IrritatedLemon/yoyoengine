/*
    Use Nuklear to add some editor ui as well as a smaller viewport synced to the current scene event

    Goals:
    - allow easily creating new render objects and events as well as dragging them around to resize and reorient
    - we need a way to put the viewport in a corner or even a seperate window?

    do we want this to live in this folder that its in rn? how to seperate the engine from the core? it needs to ship with the core
